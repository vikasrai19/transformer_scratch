    },
    {
        "user_input": "I usually use 'try-catch', but sometimes the errors still crash the app.",
        "response": "In that case, you might want to use a global error handler to catch uncaught exceptions and log them for debugging."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "How do I set up a global error handler?",
        "response": "You can use 'FlutterError.onError' for catching Flutter errors and 'runZonedGuarded' for Dart errors. Logging these can help you track down issues."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "I’ll set that up right away. Thanks!",
        "response": "Great! It’ll definitely help you catch unexpected errors. Let me know if you need more help."

    },
    {
        "user_input": "I try to follow SOLID, but sometimes my functions get too long.",
        "response": "It happens! Try breaking down long functions into smaller, reusable ones. This also makes your code easier to test."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "Good idea. I’ll refactor some of my code today.",
        "response": "That’s a smart move. Refactoring regularly keeps your codebase healthy."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "Do you have any favorite coding practices?",
        "response": "I’m a big fan of writing tests, using linting tools, and regularly reviewing code to ensure quality."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "I need to write more tests. Do you write them before or after coding?",
        "response": "I recommend writing tests before coding if possible. It helps you think through the requirements and design better code."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "That’s true. I’ll try to start doing that.",
        "response": "It might take some time to get used to, but it’s worth the effort!"
    },
    {
        "user_input": "What kind of tests should I focus on?",
        "response": "Unit tests for individual functions and classes are essential. Integration tests are also important to ensure different parts of the app work together."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "I’ve done some unit tests. I’ll start adding integration tests too.",
